## What do?

The contents of this repo occasionally end up on my blog!

1. [Write some content. or code. or css. or whatever you want](https://astro.build/). change stuff. delete stuff. see what gets approved?
2. submit a PR. if it's merged, it's probably live. nothing automated here!

## TODO

- [ ] make it dev friendly (or at least friendlier?)
- [ ] stop thinking in lists? i like lists...
- [ ] write up a `TODO` section
